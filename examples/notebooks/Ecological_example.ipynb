    "Mathematical models can be used to test hypotheses and increase our understanding of the functioning of the system they represent. Model simulations can be used to explore under which conditions a system will reach a particular state, or to anticipate the effects of human interventions. For example, a mathematical model of an ecological system represents the interactions between different species within a certain habitat. Such a model could be used to identify the conditions under which all the spieces can coexist, or the conditions that would lead to extinction of a particular species; or it could be used to assess the effects of introducing or removing a certain number of individuals of a spieces - for example through hunting or fishing. The underlying assumption here is that the model is a realistic representation of the system, so that what is learnt about the model behaviour applies to the system behaviour too. In this Notebook we show how Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can help in this context, and in particular how GSA can help identify the key controls of the system response.\n",

    "# An ecological example\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of illustration, we will use a very simple model representing the dynamics going on between two species, of which one (the prey) is the primary source of food source for the other (the predator). The predator-prey system can evolve over time towards reaching a stable equilibrium; or it can create a fluctuating pattern thanks to a negative feedback loop (Ref. 1): when the number of predators grows, the prey population declines, which reduces the predators' food source and soon leads to the predator population to also decline; when predators decline, the pressure on the preys reduces, which enable the prey population to increase again and soon leads to the predator population to also grow. \n",
    "\n",
    "<left><img src=\"eco/predator_prey_equil.gif\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use a simple model to reproduce the predator-prey dynamics (Ref. 2), which uses five parameters:\n",
    "* **Predator initial population**: the initial number of predator individuals\n",
    "* **Predator attack rate**: the number of times (per week) that a predator attack is successful, i.e. results in killing and eating a prey\n",
    "* **Predator efficiency**: the efficiency at turning food into offspring, expressed as the proportion of successful attacks that lead to creating a new predator\n",
    "* **Predator death rate**: the fraction of the predator population that dies per week\n",
    "* **Prey initial population**: initial number of prey individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be run for a simulation period (for instance 5 years) to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the prey and predator populations over that period. We will define as the **optimal habitat equilibrium** a situation where both the predator and the prey converge over time towards a stable population size (for instance 7000 individuals each). Then we may want to know which of the above parameters mostly control the possibility of reaching such equilibrium or not. This could be useful to inform the sustainable management of the habitat. For instance, if the initial number of preys or predators matter a lot, then a policy of introducing new individuals (preys or predators) would be effective. Or, if predator death rate is influential, then a policy of allowing a certain number of hunting licenses (which is a way to artificially increase the predator death rate) would be effective."
